# WMHamburgerButton
A hamburger button with nice animation.<br>
Inspired by [Popping](https://github.com/schneiderandre/popping).
Thanks for the nice project!

## Overview
The animation is created through `Core Animation`, <br>
so you don't need to rely on [pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop).<br>

<br>
And also support xib / storyboard.<br>
<br>
## Usage

The `WMHamburgerButton` is extended from `UIControl`, you can use it just like a button.<br>
Constrain it's `frame` either by `frame` property or `autoLayout`!

## AND THAT'S IT, ENJOY!
