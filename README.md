# WMHamburgerButton
A hamburger button with nice animation.<br>
Inspired by ![Popping](https://github.com/schneiderandre/popping).
Thanks for the nice repo!

## Overview
The animation is created through `Core Animation`, <br>
so you don't need to rely on ![pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop).<br>

## Usage

The `WMHamburgerButton` is extended from `UIControl`, you can use it just like a button.<br>
Constrain it's `frame` either by `frame` property or `autoLayout`!
